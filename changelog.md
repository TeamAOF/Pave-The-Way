# 1.1.1.0
- Add another component to the version to differentiate mod vs minecraft breaking changes.
- Made it so you can till the dirtier path into farmland
- Changed flattening logic:
    - When sneaking dirtier paths will revert to dirt
    - Whether sneaking or not dirt paths will turn into dirtier paths.
    - Hopefully with the tilling changes above that will then become farmland when using a mekatool.
# 1.0.1
- Lower required NF version to 21.0.81-beta.
- Loosen required Minecraft version strictness
# Pave The Way - 1.0.0
- Add dirt path from Blockus, thanks to Brandcraft for allowing us to use the textures.
- Pave The Way's dirt path can be made by flattening Vanilla's dirt path.
- Vanilla's and Pave The Way's dirt paths can be obtained with silk touch.
- Holding sneak whilst flattening reverts paths to dirt blocks, dirt can no longer be flattened into a path when sneaking.
