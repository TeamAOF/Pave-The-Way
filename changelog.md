# Pave The Way - 1.0.0
- Add dirt path from Blockus, thanks to Brandcraft for allowing us to use the textures.
- Pave The Way's dirt path can be made by flattening Vanilla's dirt path.
- Vanilla's and Pave The Way's dirt paths can be obtained with silk touch.
- Holding sneak whilst flattening reverts paths to dirt blocks, dirt can no longer be flattened into a path when sneaking.
